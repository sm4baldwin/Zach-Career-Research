### Overall Rating
**Rating**: 9/10

**Notes**: 
University of Virginia offers an exceptional education with a strong focus on both Economics and Business through the McIntire School of Commerce. The school combines academic excellence with a vibrant campus culture and strong career outcomes. The main consideration is the competitive nature of admission both to UVA and to McIntire specifically. Students interested in business/economics should have a backup plan in case McIntire admission doesn't work out, though the Economics major is also highly regarded. 

According to various sources including Niche.com, Reddit discussions, and student reviews, UVA students appreciate the balance of academic rigor and social opportunities, though the Greek life dominance can be a factor for some. The location in Charlottesville is repeatedly praised for its natural beauty and quality of life. Professional reviews from U.S. News & World Report, Poets & Quants, and Princeton Review consistently rank both UVA and McIntire among the top programs nationally.

**Key Consideration**: Economics vs. McIntire - Economics is available from freshman year, while Commerce (McIntire) requires application after sophomore year. Many students do Economics first year, then apply to McIntire. Economics offers more theoretical training and may be better for grad school, while McIntire is more applied/practical for direct entry to business careers.
